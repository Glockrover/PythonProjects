Intermediate Problem #2
Problem: Write a function that takes a string and checks if itâ€™s a palindrome (a word that reads the same backward as forward). The function should be case-insensitive and ignore spaces.

Hints:

Convert the string to lowercase and remove spaces for easier comparison.
You can use slicing to reverse the string or try a loop-based approach.
