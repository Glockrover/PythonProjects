Intermediate Problem #16
Problem: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.

For example:

For the input [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the output should be [2, 3, 5, 7].
Hints:

A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
You can use trial division up to the square root of the number to check if itâ€™s prime.
