Intermediate Problem #5
Problem: Write a function that takes two strings and returns True if one string is an anagram of the other, and False otherwise. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all original letters exactly once.

Hints:

Ignore case and spaces to make the check case-insensitive and space-insensitive.
Consider using sorting or dictionaries to compare letter frequencies.
