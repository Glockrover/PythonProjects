Intermediate Problem #7
Problem: Write a function that takes a positive integer n and returns its factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For instance, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Hints:

You can use a loop or recursion to calculate the factorial.
The factorial of 0 is 1 by definition.
