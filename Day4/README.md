Intermediate Problem #1
Problem: Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
For n > 1: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Hints:

You can solve this problem either recursively or iteratively.
Think about the efficiency of each approach as n gets larger.
