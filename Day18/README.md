Intermediate Problem #15
Problem: Write a function that takes two strings and checks if they are anagrams of each other. An anagram means both strings contain the same characters in the same frequency but possibly in a different order.

For example:

"listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
"triangle" and "integral" are anagrams.
"apple" and "pale" are not anagrams.
Hints:

Use a dictionary to count character frequencies for each string and then compare them.
Alternatively, sorting both strings and comparing them works too.
