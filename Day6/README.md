Intermediate Problem #3
Problem: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of all prime numbers in the input list. A prime number is one that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Hints:

To check if a number n is prime, verify that it has no divisors from 2 up to the square root of n.
Edge cases: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers, and for this problem, you donâ€™t need to handle negative numbers.
