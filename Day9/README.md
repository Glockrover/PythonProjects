Intermediate Problem #6
Problem: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order, and False otherwise.

Hints:

You can loop through the list and check if each element is less than or equal to the next.
Alternatively, you could compare the list to its sorted version.
