Intermediate Problem #14
Problem: Write a function that, given a list of integers, finds the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and returns the sum.

For example:

For the input [−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4], the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is [4, −1, 2, 1] with a sum of 6.
Hints:

This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach called Kadane's Algorithm.
Keep track of the maximum sum found so far as you move through the list.
