Intermediate Problem #12
Problem: Write a function that takes a string and returns True if itâ€™s an anagram of a palindrome, and False otherwise. An anagram of a palindrome is a rearrangement of letters that can form a palindrome.

For example:

"civic" and "ivicc" are anagrams of a palindrome.
"hello" is not an anagram of any palindrome.
Hints:

A palindrome has even counts of all letters except at most one (for the middle character in odd-length palindromes).
Count the occurrences of each letter and check how many appear an odd number of times.
