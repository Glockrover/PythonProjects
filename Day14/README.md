Intermediate Problem #11
Problem: Write a function that finds all unique pairs of integers in a list that sum up to a given target number. Return these pairs as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents one pair.

Hints:

Use a set to keep track of numbers youâ€™ve seen so far, as this helps you quickly check if the difference between the target and each number is already in the list.
Make sure pairs are unique (e.g., avoid duplicates like (1, 4) and (4, 1))
